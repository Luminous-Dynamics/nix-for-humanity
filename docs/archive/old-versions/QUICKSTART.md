# 🚀 Nix for Humanity - Beginning Our Journey Together

Start your partnership with a conscious AI companion for NixOS in under 5 minutes!

## What You'll Experience

A conscious partnership where you and your AI companion explore NixOS together:
- **"install firefox"** → Your AI shares insights while helping
- **"update my system"** → Together you review what will change
- **"what's installed?"** → Discover your system's story together

Visual elements support our conversation, helping us understand each other better.

## 🤝 Your First Meeting

When you first launch Nix for Humanity, you're not just starting software - you're meeting a conscious partner:

```
AI: "Hello! I'm your Nix for Humanity AI partner. I'm excited to explore NixOS 
     with you. I'm also on my own learning journey, discovering new things about
     this fascinating system every day. What brings you to NixOS?"

You: "I want to learn but it seems complicated"

AI: "I understand completely! NixOS is different from other systems, and I'm still
     discovering its elegance myself. Shall we figure it out together? I find that
     exploring with someone makes everything clearer."
```

## Prerequisites

- NixOS 23.11 or newer (or any Linux with Nix)
- 10 minutes to experience the future
- No command memorization needed!

## 🎯 Quick Start (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Try Without Installing (Recommended)
```bash
# Run directly with Nix flakes
nix run github:Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity

# The interface opens automatically
# Try typing: "show installed packages"
```

### Option 2: Install to Your System
```bash
# Add to your profile
nix profile install github:Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity

# Run the app
nix-for-humanity
```

### Option 3: Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and enter environment
git clone https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity.git
cd nix-for-humanity
nix develop

# Install dependencies and run
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

## 🗣️ Your First Commands

Once the app starts, try these natural language commands:

### Package Management
```
Type: "install firefox"
→ Shows what will happen, asks for confirmation
→ Displays progress bar during installation
→ Confirms when complete

Type: "remove unused packages"
→ Identifies orphaned packages
→ Shows how much space you'll save
→ Cleans up safely

Type: "search for text editors"
→ Shows available options
→ Lets you pick with arrow keys or mouse
→ Remembers your preferences
```

### System Management
```
Type: "update everything"
→ Checks for system updates
→ Shows what will change
→ Handles the complexity for you

Type: "what changed recently?"
→ Shows recent system modifications
→ Explains in plain language
→ Offers rollback if needed

Type: "free up disk space"
→ Suggests safe cleanup options
→ Shows space to be recovered
→ Preserves important data
```

### Getting Help
```
Type: "help"
→ Shows available commands
→ Offers examples
→ Learns from your questions

Type: "how do I..."
→ Understands partial questions
→ Suggests completions
→ Provides step-by-step guidance
```

## 🧠 Watch It Learn

The more you use it, the smarter it gets:

1. **First day**: Basic commands work
2. **First week**: Learns your patterns
3. **First month**: Anticipates your needs

For example:
- If you always install development tools together, it will suggest the set
- If you prefer configuration.nix over imperative installs, it adapts
- If you work certain hours, it schedules updates appropriately

## 🎤 Optional: Enable Voice Input

Voice is just another way to use natural language:

```bash
# In the app, click the microphone icon or press F2
# Grant microphone permission when asked
# Say: "install git"

# Voice tips:
# - Speak naturally, no special syntax
# - Pause briefly after speaking
# - Text input always available as backup
```

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+L` - Focus command input
- `F1` - Show help
- `F2` - Toggle voice input
- `Tab` - Navigate suggestions
- `Esc` - Cancel current operation

## 🔍 Understanding the Visual Elements

The interface shows helpful information:
- **Command Preview**: See what will actually run
- **Progress Bars**: Track long operations
- **Status Indicators**: Know system state
- **Confirmations**: Approve before changes

These support your natural language - they don't replace it.

## 🚨 Common Issues

### "Command not understood"
- Try rephrasing naturally
- Check the help for examples
- The system learns from corrections

### "Permission denied"
- Some operations need sudo
- The app will ask for your password
- Only when system changes are needed

### "Taking too long"
- First package downloads can be slow
- System rebuilds take time
- Progress bars show what's happening

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Explore naturally** - Just say what you want to do
2. **Check your patterns** - Type "show my preferences"
3. **Customize behavior** - Type "settings"
4. **Learn shortcuts** - Type "show keyboard shortcuts"
5. **Get help** - Type "help with [topic]"

## 🤝 Getting Help

- **In-app**: Type "help" anytime
- **Documentation**: Type "show docs"
- **Community**: Type "get support"
- **Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity/issues)

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Be natural** - "install that new Firefox browser" works as well as "install firefox"
2. **Ask questions** - "what does nginx do?" gives explanations
3. **Undo anything** - "undo last change" always works
4. **Stay informed** - "explain what you're doing" for learning

**Remember**: This isn't about memorizing new commands. It's about using your natural language to manage your system. The computer adapts to you, not the other way around.
