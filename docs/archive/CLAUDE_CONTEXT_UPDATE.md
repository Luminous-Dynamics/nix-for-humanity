# 🧠 Updated Claude Context for Nix for Humanity

## Update Instructions for CLAUDE.md

Replace the outdated Nix for Humanity documentation paths in `/srv/luminous-dynamics/CLAUDE.md` with:

```markdown
### 🗣️ Nix for Humanity - Natural Language NixOS Interface
**Vision**: Transform NixOS from command-line only to natural conversation
**Not a GUI**: Users speak/type naturally: "install firefox", "my wifi isn't working"
**Development Model**: Solo developer (Tristan) + Claude Code Max = $200/month revolution
