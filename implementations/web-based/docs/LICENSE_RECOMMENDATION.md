# License Recommendation for Nix for Humanity

## Recommended: MIT License

Given the project's philosophy of accessibility, humanity-first design, and desire to maximize adoption, I recommend the **MIT License** for the following reasons:

### Why MIT?

1. **Maximum Accessibility**
   - Aligns with "for Humanity" mission
   - No barriers to adoption
   - Can be used by individuals, schools, businesses, governments

2. **NixOS Ecosystem Compatibility**
   - Nix itself uses MIT
   - Most Nix packages are MIT/BSD
   - Reduces friction for integration

3. **Simplicity**
   - Easy to understand (even for non-lawyers)
   - No complex requirements
   - Clear and permissive

4. **Business Friendly**
   - Companies can use and contribute without legal concerns
   - Enables commercial support/services model
   - Allows proprietary extensions (while core remains open)

### Alternative Options

#### Apache 2.0
**Pros**: Patent protection, more detailed
**Cons**: More complex, may deter some contributors

#### GPL v3
**Pros**: Ensures modifications stay open
**Cons**: May limit adoption in commercial settings, conflicts with "for everyone" goal

#### Custom "Humanity License"
**Pros**: Could embed philosophical principles
**Cons**: Legal uncertainty, adoption barriers, maintenance burden

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Contribution License Agreement (CLA)
Consider a simple CLA that:
- Confirms contributors have rights to contribute
- Grants project maintainers necessary rights
- Keeps it simple (1-page maximum)

### 2. Ethical Guidelines (Non-Legal)
Separate from the license, maintain:
- Code of Conduct (already planned)
- Ethical Use Guidelines (voluntary)
- Philosophy Statement (already created)

### 3. Trademark Protection
- Register "Nix for Humanity" as a trademark
- Create usage guidelines
- Protects brand while allowing use

### 4. Dual Licensing Strategy (Future Option)
- Core: MIT (always free)
- Enterprise additions: Commercial license
- Ensures sustainability without limiting access

## Implementation Steps

1. Add `LICENSE` file to repository root
2. Update `README.md` with license badge
3. Add license headers to source files (optional but recommended)
4. Update documentation to reference license
5. Ensure all contributors agree to license

## Philosophy Alignment Check

The MIT license aligns with the project philosophy:
- ✅ **Accessible to everyone** - No restrictions on use
- ✅ **Protects user sovereignty** - Users can modify freely  
- ✅ **Enables growth** - Can be adapted for any need
- ✅ **Becomes invisible** - Simple enough to forget about
- ✅ **Serves humanity** - No artificial barriers

## Conclusion

The MIT License best serves the mission of making NixOS accessible to every human being. It removes barriers while protecting both contributors and users, enabling the project to achieve maximum positive impact.

*"The best license, like the best interface, gets out of the way and lets humanity flourish."*
