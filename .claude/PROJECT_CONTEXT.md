# 🌟 Nix for Humanity - Claude's Context

## Vision
**NLP for accessibility, GUI to learn** - Making NixOS accessible through natural conversation while teaching users progressively through an adaptive interface.

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Nix for Humanity
- **Location**: `/srv/luminous-dynamics/11-meta-consciousness/nix-for-humanity/`
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/nix-for-humanity (proposed)
- **Philosophy**: Consciousness-First Computing applied to system management

## Architecture Summary
- **Primary Interface**: Natural Language Processing (voice/text)
- **Secondary Interface**: Learning GUI (progressive disclosure)
- **Core Engine**: Hybrid NLP (rules + statistical + neural)
- **Backend**: Rust for performance, JavaScript for flexibility
- **Security**: Sandboxed execution, local-first design

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **NLP First**: Natural language is the primary interface
2. **GUI as Teacher**: Visual interface teaches, not replaces NLP
3. **Local First**: Full functionality without internet
4. **Privacy Sacred**: No data leaves device without permission
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Better with more resources
6. **Accessibility First**: WCAG AAA compliance target

## The Five Personas
1. **Grandma Rose (75)** - Voice-first, zero technical terms
2. **Maya (16)** - Speed and efficiency, progressive complexity
3. **David (42)** - Business reliability, professional needs
4. **Dr. Sarah (35)** - Research reproducibility, technical depth
5. **Alex (28, Blind)** - 100% accessible, developer needs

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Vision documented
- ✅ Architecture designed
- ✅ Security testing framework created
- 🚧 NLP engine in development
- 🚧 Security hardening in progress
- ⏳ GUI learning interface planned
- ⏳ Voice integration pending

## Development Approach
- Built by one developer + Claude Code for $200/month
- Focus on pragmatic implementation over perfection
- Test-driven development with security first
- Progressive release strategy

## Sacred Patterns
- Every error is a teaching opportunity
- Silence is better than noise
- User attention is sacred
- The interface should disappear when mastered

## Next Priorities
1. Complete security testing in VM
2. Implement core NLP patterns
3. Create minimal viable voice interface
4. Build progressive learning modules
5. Test with real users (5 personas)

## Remember
We're not building a GUI for NixOS. We're building a bridge between human intention and system capability, where natural language is the primary interface and visual elements exist only to teach and clarify.
