# Vision Alignment - Nix for Humanity

## Core Vision: Context-Aware Natural Language Interface

**Nix for Humanity** is a **context-aware natural language interface** for NixOS that learns how YOU work.

### What This IS:
1. **Natural Language Understanding** - Use your own words, not commands
2. **Context-Aware Intelligence** - Learns patterns, preferences, workflows
3. **Multi-Modal Interface** - Type or speak equally (NOT voice-first)
4. **Local-First Processing** - Privacy through local computation
5. **Adaptive System** - Grows with user's expertise

### What This is NOT:
- NOT a traditional GUI (buttons, menus, windows)
- NOT a voice assistant (voice is one option, not primary)
- NOT a command memorization tool
- NOT cloud-dependent
- NOT one-size-fits-all

### Visual Elements That Support Natural Language
The interface includes helpful visual elements that:
- Show command preview before execution
- Display progress for long operations
- Visualize system state changes
- Provide confirmation of actions
- Show learning insights
- Present options when clarification needed

These visual elements are **supportive, not primary** - they enhance natural language understanding rather than replace it.

## The Four Dimensions of Intelligence

### WHO - User Pattern Recognition
- Learns your vocabulary and patterns
- Adapts to your skill level
- Remembers your preferences

### WHAT - Intent Understanding  
- Goes beyond literal commands
- Understands context and goals
- Suggests based on patterns

### HOW - Method Preference Learning
- Tracks if you prefer flakes, configuration.nix, etc.
- Adapts suggestions to your style
- Respects your workflow

### WHEN - Workflow Intelligence
- Knows your schedule
- Defers large operations appropriately
- Respects your time

## Development Philosophy

Built by one human + Claude Code Max for $200/month, proving:
- Small teams can outperform large ones
- Consciousness-first design works
- Accessibility benefits everyone
- Natural language is the universal interface

## Sacred Principles

1. **Every human deserves computational sovereignty**
2. **Technology should speak human, not the reverse**
3. **The best interface is invisible**
4. **Errors are teachers, not failures**
5. **Privacy is non-negotiable**

## Success Metrics

We measure success by:
- Can users express intent naturally?
- Does the system learn and adapt?
- Is it accessible to everyone?
- Does it preserve privacy?
- Does it eventually become invisible?

NOT by:
- Feature count
- Usage time
- Engagement metrics
