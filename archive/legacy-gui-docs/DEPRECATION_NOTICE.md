# ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE - Legacy GUI Documentation

## These Documents Are Archived

This directory contains documentation from the previous GUI-centric approach to Nix for Humanity. These documents are **deprecated** and kept only for historical reference.

## Current Approach

Nix for Humanity has evolved to a **Natural Language First** approach where:
- Users interact through natural language (typed or spoken)
- GUI elements are optional learning aids only
- The interface is language, not visual components

## Do Not Use These Documents For:
- ❌ Current development
- ❌ Understanding the project vision
- ❌ Implementation guidance
- ❌ User documentation

## Instead, Use:
- ✅ [Main README](/README.md) - Current project vision
- ✅ [NATURAL_LANGUAGE_GUIDE](/NATURAL_LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md) - How to interact
- ✅ [Current Documentation](/docs/) - Updated guides
- ✅ [DOCUMENTATION_INDEX](/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) - What's current

## Why These Are Archived

These documents represent an earlier phase where we believed a GUI with voice commands was the solution. We've since realized that natural language understanding is the real breakthrough, with GUI being merely an optional enhancement.

## Historical Context

- **Created**: 2024-2025
- **Approach**: Traditional GUI with voice as an add-on
- **Archived**: 2025-07-23
- **Reason**: Paradigm shift to natural language first
